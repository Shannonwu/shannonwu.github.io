<p>哈姆雷特与欲念危机</p>
<p>（节译自Ehsan Azari,Lacan and the Destiny of Literature）</p>
<p>Hamlet and the crisis of desire</p>
<p>The tragedy of Hamlet interested Lacan chiefly because of its spectacular structure, Oedipal backdrop, and Shakespeare’s unique poetic skills in dramatizing desire in crisis. Lacan admits this at the outset of his remarks on Hamlet in hisSeminar VI: Le Désir et son Interprétation when he says that the play has ‘[a]n excep- tional power of captivation’ (Lacan, 1977, 11). Lacan’s theory of desire comes into full swing in his criticism of Hamlet and is of special significance for literary studies because, for Lacan, Hamlet was a modern hero caught up in the Other’s desire. This point is cardinal because it answers the question raised by tradi- tional Shakespearean studies about the play: why did Shakespeare subvert the traditional Aristotelian definition of tragedy? From Dr Johnson to Eliot, for many critics the character of Hamlet was a mistake on Shakespeare’s part because he fails to provide a clear-cut reason for Hamlet’s indecision. T. S. Eliot continued such an arguably humanist literary exegetics in expressing difficulty with both Hamlet as a drama and Hamlet as the character in his brief essay on the Shakespearean text. In order to show the significance of Lacan’s sustained criticism of Hamlet for contemporary poststructuralist Shakespearean studies, we will first clarify Eliot’s trouble with Hamlet. T. S. Eliot writes, ‘[s]o far from being Shakespeare’s masterpiece, the play [Hamlet] is most certainly an artistic failure. In several ways the play is puzzling, and disquieting as is none of the others . . . It is the “Mona Lisa” of literature’ (Eliot, 1975, 47). Eliot seems to have trouble with Shakespeare’s subversion of the traditional norms of tragedy and the tragic hero. He highlights the following enigmas in his reading ofHamlet: the neither effect of Hamlet’s mother’s guilt on her son that neither can be expressed, nor does Shakespeare succeed in treating it properly, or artic- ulating the two of them in art; and Hamlet’s emotions and feelings are so intense and excessive that they remain beyond objectification. Such a mental state makes Hamlet ‘[d]oubtless a subject of study for a pathologist’ (49). We can see these statements as the final words of traditional humanist literary criticism of the play. On the other hand, Lacan’s reading of Shakespeare’s text as a drama of desire helps unravel many of the mysteries of Hamlet.</p>
<p>Let us begin with answering the important question: why is Hamlet a tragedy of desire?</p>
<p>Lacan points to a major breakdown in the path of Hamlet’s desire, a break- down through which he ends up lost in a chaotic desire. He doesn’t know how to desire, mainly because his desire is not his own. Instead, he carries Gertrude’s desire as his Other. Hamlet’s total reliance on the Other’s desire brings out an effect of incongruity within the structure of registers, mainly because of an incoherent incorporation of the imaginary and symbolic in his subjectivity. This makes it impossible for him to be integrated successfully into the symbolic reg- ister. In other words, Hamlet’s inability to assimilate his desire beyond the Oedipal triangle into the symbolic is the primary reason for this chaotic desire th-</p>
<p>at Lacan terms the tragedy of desire in Hamlet. Lacan translates Freud’s term for Hamlet, a ‘tragedy of destiny’, into the tragedy of desire. As Freud says in ‘On Hamlet and Oedipus’, Hamlet is a Renaissance immitation of Oedipus Rex. Freud saw the play as an effect of the incompatibility of the will and destiny, as was Sophocles’s play: ‘[i]ts tragic effect is said to lie in the contrast between the supreme will of the gods and the vain attempts of mankind to escape the evil that threatens them’ (Freud, 1970a, 81). In the Lacanian approach, this tragic effect is seen to develop because of the conflict between human desire and the law of the super-ego. This conflict in desire shows itself in Hamlet’s hesitation, procrastination, mourning, indecision, feigned madness and so on that make his self divided between his weak ego, the object of his desire and the Other, the place from where he gets the assurance of his own existence and discourse.</p>
<p>Contrary to Eliot’s assertion, Shakespeare has successfully illustrated the ambiguous state in which Hamlet continuously procrastinates and remains indecisive through unpredictable changes of behaviour. He breaks with Ophe- lia for no reason, an event which shows the rise of an imbalance in his uncon- scious fantasy. Because of this imbalance, Hamlet loses any guarantee of the stability of his desire. This is the moment identified by Lacan as the moment of Hamlet’s depersonalization, when he rejects Ophelia, because from then on she is no longer an object a in relation to Hamlet’s desire. She represents the primal object of desire of which he is deprived in the symbolic. When Hamlet was still in love with Ophelia, her position as an object a in fantasy had offered him a stage on which to play out his desire. Ophelia, from this point on, leaves the stage of fantasy in Hamlet’s desire. We learn of this when Ophelia brings the news of the sudden change in Hamlet’s behaviour to Polonius. This sudden change means for Lacan a subjective rupture that is caused by a disparity between the components of fantasy, the barred subject and the object a. This shift also triggers an outcome that reveals a pathological crossover from uncon- scious thought into a conscious message. Lacan further observes that because of such a disparity, Freud conceptualized the Unheimlich (uncanny), a moment in which the imaginary limit between the subject and the object changes. This sudden change freezes the subject and something that was hidden from him becomes visible. Ophelia discloses this irruption in Hamlet that changes him from what she has earlier described as ‘the glass of fashion’, and ‘mould of form’, into someone who has just emerged from ‘hell’:</p>
<p>My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,</p>
<p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,</p>
<p>No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,</p>
<p>Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle,</p>
<p>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,</p>
<p>And with a look so piteous in purport</p>
<p>As if he had been loosed out of hell</p>
<p>To speak of horrors, he comes before me.</p>
<p>(H, II, i, 87–94)</p>
<p>This uncanny irruption in Hamlet once again reveals itself in the graveyard scene, where the dead Ophelia, the abandoned object, becomes a fetishized object of his desire. Hamlet shows his passionate love for the dead Ophelia, an object that he cannot have any more. This produces ‘[a] reintegration of the object a, won back here at the price of mourning and death’ (Lacan, 1977, 24). This restoration of the object brings Hamlet’s desire to boiling point and causes him to jump into her tomb in order to prevent his rival, Laertes, from grabbing the symbolic phallus. When she is loved, she is an object a, and when dead in a tomb she represents the empty space, the dead body, and the lack of the phallus. Such moments, in which rivalry, aggression and ambivalence towards the idealized object take place, are repeated several times in the play. The fenc- ing scene, for example, upsets the balance in desire when the resurgence of the imaginary into the symbolic register takes place, changing Hamlet from an indecisive posture into an aggressive stance of action. In such instances, as Lacan puts it, ‘[t]he playwright situates the basis of aggressivity in this paroxysm of absorption in the imaginary register, formally expressed as a mirror relation- ship, a mirrored reaction’ (31). In the graveyard scene, an imaginary inscription of desire emerges in the symbolic, and the ghost in the play represents the emergence of the real in the symbolic. Lacan sees the symptomatic aspect of Hamlet’s desire in this imbalance that is inscribed in the play in a series of bizarre actions. The real cuts through the symbolic in terms of uncanny and bizarre in this play, for it as we often insist are inassimilable in the symbolic. Lacan observes Hamlet’s dragging of Polonius’ body, the hiding of the corpse and the graveyard on the stage as among the gaps in the real that emerge uncensored in Shakespeare’s play. The gap in the real and consequently in the existence of the subject, as Lacan emphasizes, cannot be articulated in the sig- nifying chain because of the limit of language in homogenizing the real. These gaps locate Hamlet and his desire in what Lacan calls ‘the blackout of signifiers’ (49). This blackout or syncope means that when an act or gesture doesn’t lend itself to signification, it emerges in the real. This is a situation of a total loss where the function of speech – the symbolic exchange and the function of love – transference – all fail. This means that the configuration of the Oedipal love-bond fails to cross over to the symbolic bond of love. Desire of man is indeed hell as Lacan said in response to a question by Marcel Ritter (Marini, 1992, 243). This hell is where Hamlet turns into a ‘coward’, a natural result of a chaotic desire, as Lacan writes, ‘[d]esire, what is called desire, suffices to make life meaningless if it turns someone into a coward’ (Lacan, 2006, 661).</p>
